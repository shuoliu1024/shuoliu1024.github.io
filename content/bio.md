Hi! I'm Shuo, currently a master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Washington (UW). I am also a student researcher working with the Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research (PRIOR) team at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2).

At AI2, I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Ranjay Krishna](https://ranjaykrishna.com) and [Dr. Jiafei Duan](https://duanjiafei.com/), and pleased to be mentored by [Prof. Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/). Before this, I received my bachelor's degree in Robot Engineering from Southeast University, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Chengxin Wang](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/wcx/list.htm#).  

My research interests primarily focus on robot learning. Specifically, I investigate how to develop general robot operation policies and how to adapt them to specific scenarios during actual deployment.

**I am actively seeking Research Engineer / Assistant positions in Robotics. Feel free to reach out!**
